It's my personal website hosted by GitHub Pages. There's nothing too much interesting here for now.
I couldn't get gitlab's one to work because of their highly-protected system, which requires a credit card verification. I do have one but it's not international, therefore 💀
And also, I don't like GitHub personallly because it's owned by Microsoft now, but I have no other option, currently. I just want a simple static site as of now. Maybe I'll make this site into a dynamic one, and move it to a custom web server later, but it just depends on how successful this project will be.
So yeah, just give me sometime, and I'll see what to do about my domain...
