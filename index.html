<!-- Introduction -->
<p>This is my personal website, where I try to put some content together to ultimately build some resources, that I think will help others to live their lives better. Of course, it's more than just that. Here, I like to express my piece of mind which includes ideologies, comments on news, reviews, ideas and so much more. I also like meet new people like yourself, so please don't be shy to contact me. We can be good friends :)<br>
This was a summary of what I have done here, if you want to know more, head over to <a href="./about-me">my about page</a>.</p>
<p>The site is under active development, therefore don't expect it to be usable</p>
