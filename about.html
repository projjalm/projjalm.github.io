<p>Here's a little bit about myself</p>

</header>

<!-- Introduction -->
<p>A 19-year-old student from West Bengal, India.</p>

<p>Interests include Computer science, programming, maths, and technology in general.</p>

<p>Die-hard fan of IGI, a tactical stealth FPS which (kind of) describes my personality. If you didn't heard of it, I really recommend checking it out. (just search Project IGI in any SE and you'll get on the right track ;)</p>

<p>I use Linux and am a heavy Free and Open source software supporter, but not a contributor till, as I don't have skill in software development ;P<br>
But as always, I try to defend free software in conversations and spread the word of it</p>

<p>Musical taste isn't really inclined to any genre or artist, I just like those type of songs, which a sweet melody or nerve-shaking beats inthem, which (most of the time) is inclusive in electro-pop or EDM. Yes, I'm a Walker, but haven't figured out the number yet xD</p>

<p>Not a fan of restrictive copyright licenses. I don't really believe in locking down your work so no one can build amazing things upon it, it's just a retarded idea. And the same for the current advertisement model, they are too distractive and create more noise in world. Instead of that, there should be a model which automatically increases the popularity of a work by the amount of time a viewer spends interacting with it.</p>

<p>I do hate current education system a lot because of way too many reasons. Some of them are -<br>
<ul>
<li>Education is viewed as a one-time process whereas it is a life long process, and can't be done in the first few years of your life.</li>
<li>Studying the theory before experiencing anything about the topic, while doing a task practically by yourself is the real way to learn about it. It might take a longer time but it'll last longer than reading a few pages about it from a book.</li>
<li>You're afraid to make mistakes while learning, but in reality, making mistakes and solving them is the best way to learn everything. Yes, everything!</li>
<li>People don't have any freedom relative to what they're studying (even in higher levels!). Your fate is decided by the mixed decisions of your parents, teachers  and this crap system. You can't change your course to the subject you wish anytime. Some hippie old man "standized" all these strange rules, and you have to follow in order to decide what you'lldo in future. No, it's not total anarchism but a system which respects every 13+ individual's decision that is required.</li>
<li>Denial of knowledge. Yes, you heard right. No one is allowed to learn not more and not less than what's prescribed in syllabus. If you ask me, knowledge should be free and provided in enormous amounts to extinguish the fire of curiosity, and that's what's the school is supposed to do, not create several barriers in someone's advancement, just to pass a shitty exam. Everything's technologically advancing, right? You know what's not? Our education. That is still stuck in industrial revolution.</li>
</ul>
